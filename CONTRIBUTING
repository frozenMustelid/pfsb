Should be pretty simple. Download. Read the CONTRIBUTOR AGREEMENT. Make changes.
Document changes. Add self to CONTRIBUTORS file, using any name you choose (or
be anonymous if you prefer). Send changed files back using whatever method you
prefer.

For some changes (like adding new games to PFSB's monster generator), you may
want to read the OGL too. A copy should have been included with the program, as
should the CONTRIBUTORS file. It shouldn't be necessary to update the OGL's
copyright notice.

Is is preferred that you try to match styles with the existing codebase. This
doesn't have to include profane rants or sophomoric jokes in the code comments,
but it can if you feel it's warranted. Matching styles includes keeping the
documentation cat-friendly.

Also preferred is testing your changes. See if it still builds, didn't include
too many regressions, the fix actually fixes what it's supposed to fix, etc.
Obviously pobody's nerfect, but a modicum of testing helps out immensely. Note:
If it doesn't build on my machine, AFAIC it doesn't build on anyone's machine
except maybe the submitter's.

That said: If you send me something better than what I have, I'll almost 
certainly include it. Even a half-baked implementation is better than no
implementation, unless it somehow reduces functionality of working things.


ROADMAP
     *SLAs and spells planned for 0.3
     *GUI will probably show up before 1.0
     *Save/load IP creatures expected to appear with GUI.
     *Change to a PDF output will likely be near the 1.0 release. As long as the
          output remains HTML-based, it is expected that the program may make
          mistakes that the user will have to correct by manually editing the
          HTML file.
     *Move all OGL stuff to a seperate repo, which PFSB grabs as part of the
          install/build process. Probably pre-1.0, maybe even before 0.10.
     *Templates are complicated, almost definitely post-1.0
