1. A C++ compiler that supports C++14.
2. Better make sura that compiler is G++. There's no program logic tied to the
	compiler or its extensions, but the Makefile won't work if it can't use G++
	to compile.
3. A /usr/bin folder.
4. A /usr/share folder.
5. A web browser. Strictly speaking, the browser isn't necessary, but unless you
	prefer reading raw HTML over a nicely CSS-styled HTML document, you'll want
	one.
