Current:
	*DR and SR not implemented due to oversight
	*SLAs not implemented... Yet.
	*Program does little user entry verification and is fragile as a result
	*Only creature icon implemented is "construct"
	*No icons for environment or climate
	*No logic to pick an icon for environment or client
	*Program, despite being written in standard C++14, only runs on *nix
	*Program, despite being written in standard C++14, requires G++
	*Program produces unrepresentable characters at the end of the file. I
		suspect that this is an extra  EOF character. xed renders this
		as umlaut y when I set the html charset tage to utf-8, but
		without that tag, xed instead renders '\FF'. Firefox renders
		these as question mark diamonds.

Changed:
