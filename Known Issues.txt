Current:
    *No icons for environment or climate
    *No logic to pick an icon for environment or client
    *Only creature icon implemented is "construct"
    *Program, despite being written in standard C++14, only runs on *nix
    *Program, despite being written in standard C++14, requires G++
    *Program does more user entry verification and is less fragile as a result
    *Program is not distributed as Free Software
    *Program produces unrepresentable characters at the end of the file. I
        suspect that this is an extra  EOF character. xed renders this
        as umlaut y when I set the HTML charset tag to utf-8, but
        without that tag, xed instead renders '\FF'. Firefox renders
        these as question mark diamonds.
    *XP value always has at least 1 extra space. However, this doesn't appear to
        actually render.


Changed since last release:
    +SLA system assumes CL = HD and does not account for Concentration-boosting
        feats.
    +SLA system only handles racial SLAs

    
    -SLAs not implemented... Yet.

    ->Program does little user entry verification and is fragile as a result
