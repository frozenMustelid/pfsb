	This file follows the example of the Linux kernel's CREDITS file.
	(N) is name. (E) is email. (W) is web address. (D) is a brief
	description of the person's contribution. "Contribution" can mean
	someone directly sent a pull request or patch to me, or it can
	mean that I found a piece of license-compatible code and decided
	to use it. If you wish to remain an anonymous contributor, send me
	a message to tell me to not post your N/E/W/D(s).

NOTE: Not currently accepting contributions. The reason for this is because I'm
not a big fan of the program's current license, and would like to have the
ability to change it without getting in contact with every contributor and
a) Convinving them to let me change their contribution's license, or
b) Rewriting all code I didn't write. I left this file in here because I'd lose
it if I just removed it from the archival folder, and the "post nudes" joke was
too good to lose to time.
